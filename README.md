# Lidar Scanning Robot

## Project Overview
This project focuses on simulating a LiDAR-equipped robot within the Gazebo environment. The goal is to replicate real-world scenarios in simulation, allowing for testing and development in a controlled virtual space.

The robot will support teleoperation via keyboard control, enabling manual navigation and experimentation with sensor data.
